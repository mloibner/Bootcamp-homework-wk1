Horiseon Webpage clean up. 

This assignment is being submitted late as I could not get the project github link to correctly display content and realised there was an internet delay on the webpage loading in browser after being deployed. 

I have tried to tidy the css and the html as much as possible however ran out of time trying to fix the layout of the benefits nav to position correctly on the webpage. 
I also tried to make page as accessable as possible by adding ALT to each image. 
Title has been replaced with descriptive wording. 
Semantic HTML elements used and heading attributes in sequential order. I also re did the CSS to ensure the order of classes followed the order of elements that the class belong to as per the HTML.
